# ToDo Application

A simple ToDo application built for learning JavaScript. This app allows users to add, mark as completed, and remove tasks. Tasks are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox.
- Remove tasks from the list.
- Persistent storage using `localStorage`.
